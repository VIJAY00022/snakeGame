Snake Game in Java
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java. The game involves controlling a snake on a bordered plane and attempting to eat food represented by asterisks ("*"). As the snake consumes food, it grows in length, making the game more challenging.

Features:
Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
Food Generation: Random food (asterisks) appear on the game board for the snake to consume.
Score Tracking: The score increases each time the snake eats food, providing feedback to the player.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake, walls, and itself, triggering the end of the game.
How to Play:
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
Navigate the snake to consume food (asterisks) on the game board.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
Grow the snake and achieve a high score.
